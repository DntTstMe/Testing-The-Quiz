# Testing-The-Quiz
A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions


## Description
* My motivation for this project was to create a timed coding quiz for programmers wanting to test their knowledge.
* I created this quiz to exercise my knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery while creating as fun quiz.
* This project allows programmers to test their knowledge against the clock while being deducted 5 seconds for each wrong answer.
* I learned that dedicating your time and putting in the work is both rewarding and enlightening. I learned a lot and feel more confident in myself than I did previously.
* I feel that my project stands out because it is a piece of me that I put lots of hardwork and time into it so that I could feel proud of how far I have already come in the program.
